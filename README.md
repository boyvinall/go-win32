# go-win32

This is a collection of win32 syscall functions that I needed but couldn't find implemented anywhere else.
Hopefully useful to someone somewhere someday.

As of right now, it exists only to fulfil my needs, so it's a very sparse implementation. May be extended
as time goes by (or pull requests....).  :bowtie:
